<b><h2>Some useful information....</b></h2>


* Always use MFA, especially for accounts with elevated privileges

* Do NOT use the "Root Account" use and create alternative accounts with the necessary roles and policies

* Avoid using the default VPC (172.31.x.x) got bitten several times due to IP conflicts

* ALWAYS use a proper <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html"> Tagging policy</a>

* Ensure you have <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html"> Billing alerts</a> set to avoid having surprise

* If you are using AWS networking, make sure you have a good IP Plan and a good BGP assignment plan and look into IPv6 as we will soon need it :)
